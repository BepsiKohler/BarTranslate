Translations are done by presenting a simple (altered) webview of translate.google.com in a quick and easily accessible interface.

   * Option to enable/disable top bar

# Extra information
* BarTranslate version 0.1 (BETA)
* BarTranslate is still in development, meaning that a) minor issues may arise and b) its functionality is not (yet) as extensive as I plan to.
* MacOS Sierra (10.12) or above is required.
