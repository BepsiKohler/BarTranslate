## Notice for Developers

BarTranslate has recently been rewritten from scratch and made open source.
The initial app was programmed in Swift, but I have decided to move to Electron/TypeScript/React
for cross-platform compatibility and reduced development time.

I develop and test BarTranslate mainly on MacOS, meaning there <ins>may be bugs</ins>
when the app is built on Windows or Linux. If you notice any problems, feel free to open an issue or pull request.

If you want to help distribute the executables for Windows or Linux, please [let me
know](https://github.com/ThijmenDam/BarTranslate/discussions)!
